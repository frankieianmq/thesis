This code will generate jobs for DS-Sim and also will be where I analyse logs, create models, and implement generate jobs.
There are 3 files currently which are:
- analyseLogs.py: Analyse logs using libraries such as matplotlib
- main.py: Implementation of generation of jobs for DS-Sim
- parse_logs.py: Functions that parses workload logs
