This code will generate jobs for DS-Sim and also will be where I analyse logs, create models, and implement generate jobs.
The files are:
- analyseLogs.py: Analyse logs using libraries such as matplotlib
- main.py: Implementation of generation of jobs for DS-Sim
- parse_logs.py: Functions that parses workload logs
- old_jobgen.py: Conversion of ds-sim's job generation into python

The folders are:
- Component: All the components for generation for jobs
- configs: This folder has all the configs for testing, and a jobs xml example
- Distribution Fitting: This file contains the top 20 lowest SSE values for each fitted attributed
